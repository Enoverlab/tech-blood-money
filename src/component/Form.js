            <p>
                Olabanji Ewenla is a Product Manager who is passionate 
                about delivering consistent value to end-users and ensuring a 
                productâ€™s success in the marketplace. <br />
                He is very particular about growth and so focuses on driving 
                sustainable business growth for organisations. He has been at 
                the core of leading the growth initiatives at Perxels - from having a community 
                of just 15 people to 5,000+ people all over the world in less than 2 years while 
                increasing the business revenue to over 400% in the same time. <br />
                One of the major initiatives which he introduced at Perxels is building a structure 
                to help Perxels students get jobs after their training. This initiative has been a 
                great success, with 70% of Perxels students getting well-paying jobs, gigs or 
                contracts within 3 months after their training.<br /><br />

                He is also the co-founder of Enoverlab, an incubation training program to empower 
                Product Managers with the knowledge, skills, and experience to build products that 
                will thrive today, tomorrow, and in the future. <br /><br />

                He loves education and naturally loves teaching, sharing knowledge, passing ideas, 
                having brainstorming sessions, conducting research and doing anything that 
                involves education. <br /><br />

                Outside of work, Olabanji is a musician; he sings, plays the piano and directs a 
                worship team.
